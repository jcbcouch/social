I've set up the federation system for your social network! Here's a summary of what's been implemented:

1 HTTP Signatures Middleware
    Secure server-to-server communication
    Request signing and verification
    Development mode with signature verification bypass
2 Federation Routes
    WebFinger endpoint for user discovery
    User actor profiles
    Shared inbox for receiving activities
    User-specific inboxes
    Outbox for user activities
3 ActivityPub Support
    Follow/Unfollow
    Create/Delete posts
    Like/Boost
    Undo actions
4 Utility Functions
    Activity creation helpers
    Note creation
    Inbox delivery
    Actor resolution
5 Documentation
    Updated README with federation guide
    API endpoint documentation
    Setup and configuration instructions
6 To test the federation:
    Start two instances on different ports (e.g., 3000 and 3001)
    Update their 
    .env
    files with different SERVER_DOMAIN and add each other to PEERS
    Use the API to create users and test following between instances

Next steps could be:

Implement post federation
Add WebFinger support
Create admin tools for instance management
